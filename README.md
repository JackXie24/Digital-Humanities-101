This repository contains my group and individual projects for the Digital Humanities 101 - Practicing the Digital Humanities.

### Individual Project Abstract:
The goal of this project is to quantify the influences of temperature and humidity on the transmissibility of COVID-19, through analyzing COVID-19 data from the U.S. COVID-19 data (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data), the global climate data (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/access/), and the world population data (https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/) with statistical analysis, data visualization. And I will be using Seaborn, Plotly, Pandas to visualize the trend for the COVID-19 transmission progression, and trying to find the factors that impact the transmission rate of COVID-19, specifically Temperature. I will be trying to answer the below questions: What the relationship between Covid-19 and Temperature be like? can higher Temperatures in the tropical areas help to prevent or slow down the transmission rate?
